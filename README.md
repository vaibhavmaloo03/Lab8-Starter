Remember this topic? A refresher... graceful degradation is when we start with max technology and hopefully address lower levels with grace. Remember with progressive enhancement (labs 2 - 4), we taught you to write HTML first, then enhance it with CSS, then enhance it with JS. This is the same thing, but the other way around. Graceful degradation is great for applications, but resilience, performance, and a11y must be carefully added. You even dealt with some graceful degradation in the last lab with making web components!
