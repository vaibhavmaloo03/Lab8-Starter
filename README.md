Graceful degradation and service workers are both crucial concepts in web development that enhance the resilience and user experience of web applications. Graceful degradation focuses on building a robust application using the latest technologies while ensuring that it remains functional on older browsers or in environments with limited capabilities. Service workers contribute to graceful degradation by enabling offline access, caching, and resource management. They ensure that even if certain advanced features or network connectivity are unavailable, the application can still function with a baseline level of performance and usability. By intercepting network requests and serving cached content when necessary, service workers help maintain a seamless user experience, embodying the principles of graceful degradation by addressing lower levels of technology gracefully.
